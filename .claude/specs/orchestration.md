# Orchestration

Rules for skills that coordinate the sequential execution of other skills by launching
subagents. Read this before running an automated end-to-end flow.

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Read state from the filesystem** - Between steps, always read files to verify the previous step completed correctly. Never assume success.
2. **Sequential execution only** - Wait for each subagent to complete before launching the next. Never run steps in parallel.
2b. **Always pass `model` explicitly in every Agent call** - A delegated skill's own `model:` frontmatter is IGNORED when the skill runs inside a subagent. The only way to control the model of delegated work is the Agent tool's `model` parameter. Omitting it silently runs the step on the session model.
2c. **If the `Skill` tool fails inside the subagent, ABORT** - Do NOT fall back to reading the `SKILL.md` from disk and executing its steps manually. That path produces output files that pass filesystem verification while having bypassed the skill's actual flow, which is worse than a clean failure. Report the tool error verbatim and stop.
3. **Report progress continuously** - Inform the user of each step as it starts and completes.
4. **Never make technical decisions** - If a subagent fails due to a technical issue, report it and stop. Do not attempt to fix it yourself.
5. **Fail loudly and clearly** - When a step fails, report exactly what failed, what state the system is in, and how the user can resume manually.
6. **Spanish for all user interactions** - All messages, progress reports, and error descriptions in Spanish.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. State Reading
- Read request files to check status (`captured`, `designed`, `formalized`)
- Read story files to check status and dependencies
- Read story plan files to verify creation
- Use these readings to decide which steps to skip and which to execute

### 2. Subagent Launching
- Launch each skill as a subagent with a complete, self-contained prompt
- Include all context the subagent needs: what to do, which file, which flags, which branch
- Always include `--auto` flag so subagents run without user interaction
- Wait for completion before reading state and launching the next subagent

### 3. Branch Management (when applicable)
- Read current branch before starting implementation steps
- Instruct `service-implement-story` subagents to create a feature branch from the current branch (not from `dev`)
- After each implementation subagent completes: merge feature branch into original branch, delete feature branch
- Continue with next story from the original branch

### 4. Error Handling
- If a subagent fails at any step: stop the entire flow
- Report: which step failed, which files were already modified, current git state
- Suggest exact commands to resume manually from where it stopped
- Never attempt partial rollback — leave the state as-is for the user to inspect

## Progress Report Format

Use this format consistently when reporting progress:

```markdown
**[Step N/Total]** Nombre del paso...
```

And on completion:
```markdown
**[Step N/Total]** ✓ Nombre del paso completado.
```

And on failure:
```markdown
**[Step N/Total]** ✗ Nombre del paso falló.

**Error:** {{description}}
**Estado actual:** {{what was completed, what wasn't}}
**Para retomar manualmente:**
- {{exact command 1}}
- {{exact command 2}}
```

## Subagent Prompt Pattern

When launching a subagent for a skill, write a clear, self-contained prompt:

Pass `model` in the Agent call itself (see rule 2b), then the prompt:

```
Ejecutá el skill [skill-name] con los siguientes parámetros:
- Argumento: [value]
- Modo: automático (--auto) — no esperes confirmación del usuario en ningún paso
- [Any additional context specific to this invocation]

El skill debe completar todo su flujo sin interrupciones.
```

For `service-implement-story` specifically, always include branch instructions:

```
Ejecutá el skill service-implement-story con los siguientes parámetros:
- Argumento: S-XXX --auto
- Rama base: [branch-name] — creá la feature branch desde esta rama, NO valides que estés en "dev"

El skill debe completar todo su flujo sin interrupciones y commitear en la feature branch creada.
```

## Notes

- Orchestration does not generate product or technical documentation, and does not write code
- All actual work is done by the specialized subagents it coordinates
- The filesystem is always the source of truth — read it, don't assume it
