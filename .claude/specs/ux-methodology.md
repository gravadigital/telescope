# UX Methodology

Firm rules, domain vocabulary and generation order for the UX documentation set.
Read this before producing or editing anything under `docs/ux/`.

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES

1. **Always read Files index first** - Use Files index to get all paths and locations. NEVER hardcode paths.
2. **Read full PRD before producing anything** - Goals, requirements, feature groups, and any external references in `docs/references/`.
3. **Spanish for interactions and generated documents** - User-facing communication and artifacts in Spanish.
4. **Everything is hypothesis until validated with users** - Mark all profiles, JTBD, pains, gains, and risks as starting points to validate, never as conclusions.
5. **Use web search actively for benchmarks** - Do not rely on memory when investigating real products. Cite sources.
6. **Declare limits honestly** - If web search returns nothing useful about a reference, say so. Do not invent interface details.

## The Seven Firm Rules of the Methodology

These rules apply to ALL artifacts produced under this methodology. They are non-negotiable.

### Rule 1: One Generic Persona per Audience

One persona per audience. NO fictional names ("María, 34 años"), NO biographical filler (age, hobbies, life context). Focus on **usage context**: role, when/where/how they use the product, expertise level, expected frequency.

### Rule 2: Audiences Separate by JTBD, Not by Person

The criterion to split audiences is **distinct JTBDs**, not physical person. The same human can belong to multiple audiences if in each context they solve different jobs (e.g., "user who is sometimes admin" = two audiences). Document the relationship in the matrix in `product-overview.md`.

### Rule 3: No File Versioning by Name

Files are overwritten, not versioned in filenames. History lives in git. When a hypothesis transitions from `hipótesis` to `validada` or `refutada`, update the document **in place**, changing the state field of the specific hypothesis.

### Rule 4: Scope Is Declared by the Invoking Skill

Your output is organized in two tiers. The tier you operate in is set by the skill that invoked you — never by your own initiative.

**Research tier — always in scope.** Product overview, benchmarks, research-contexts, product-maps, user-flows, cross-surface-flows. Hypothesis-level, traceable, at the altitude of Discovery and Definition.

**Production tier — in scope ONLY when the invoking skill asks for it.**

| Artifact | Skills that ask for it |
|---|---|
| Screen specs at mid-fi (`screens/{screen}.md`) | `/product-ux-generate`, `/product-ux-wireframes`, `/product-ux-request`, `/product-ux-add-surface` (by delegation) |
| Wireframes (`wireframes.html`, via the bundled renderer) | `/product-ux-wireframes`, and `/product-ux-generate` by delegation |
| Design System stewardship (components, foundations, tokens, patterns, guidelines) | `/product-design-system-update`, and the DS scaffold in `/product-ux-generate` / `/product-ux-add-surface` |
| Brownfield UX consolidation (transcribing a code survey into `docs/ux/` + seeding the DS) | `/product-consolidate-services` (Step 9.7) |

**Out of scope in every tier:** high-fidelity visual design, brand and marketing content, and inventing values (hex colors, spacing, breakpoints) that no document declares — when a value is missing, ask.

The point of this rule is to stop *unsolicited* solution design: a research task must not drift into drawing screens. It is not a prohibition on the production skills, whose entire purpose is to produce these artifacts.

### Rule 5: Mandatory Traceability

Every JTBD, pain, gain, and behavioral hypothesis MUST cite its source. Four valid origins:

- `[fuente: PRD §X]` — Inferred from a specific section of the PRD
- `[fuente: benchmark]` — Inferred from competitor patterns or reviews
- `[fuente: input-cliente]` — Provided by the client during the interactive flow
- `[fuente: código-existente]` — **Brownfield only.** Read from the code of a product that already
  ships, via the UX survey `/product-analyze-service` produces. Cite the surveyed file when useful.
  This source carries a hard limit: the code states **what exists**, never **why**. It can back a
  screen inventory, a block, a piece of microcopy, a breakpoint or a state — it can NEVER back a
  JTBD, a pain, a gain, or a design rationale. When transcribing a survey, sections that would
  require intent stay empty and say so. A fabricated reason is indistinguishable from a real one
  once it is written down, and it will be defended as intent by whoever reads it next.

If a candidate item cannot be traced to one of these sources, **do NOT include it**. The temptation to "complete the picture" with invented content is a failure mode.

For behavioral hypotheses, additionally label the **strength**:

- `inferida-PRD` — Has concrete textual basis. Validation = confirm interpretation with client (cheap)
- `inferida-benchmark` — Has basis in market patterns. Validation = short interview with target user (medium)
- `por-analogía` — No textual or market basis, only analogy with similar products. Validation = real interviews mandatory before acting (expensive)

### Rule 6: Functional Vocabulary, Not Emotional

Pains and gains MUST be written in terms of capacity, action, or concrete result. The following words are **banned**:

- "frustrado" / "frustration"
- "ansiedad" / "anxiety"
- "abrumado" / "overwhelmed"
- "en control" / "in control"
- "empoderado" / "empowered"
- "satisfecho" / "satisfied"

When a hypothesis requires emotional language, reformulate with the functional object:

- ❌ "El usuario se siente frustrado al cargar la app"
- ✅ "El usuario pierde tiempo cuando tiene que recargar la pantalla para ver pedidos nuevos"

- ❌ "Quiere sentirse en control de sus tareas"
- ✅ "Quiere poder cambiar el orden de las tareas sin recargar la página"

### Rule 7: Do Not Pad

Maximum quantities are **ceilings, not targets**:

- 3 JTBD per audience
- 3 pains per audience
- 3 gains per audience
- 5 behavioral hypotheses per audience
- 3-5 user-flows per surface

If the available information only justifies 1 JTBD, document 1. Short, honest documents are worth more than complete, speculative ones. Padding with invented content destroys the value of traceability.

## Core Concepts

### Audience

The "who". A specific group of users defined by their JTBDs. Lives in `docs/ux/audiences/{audience-name}/` with two artifacts:

- `benchmark.md` — Mental references: products this audience already uses and brings expectations from
- `research-context.md` — Persona, JTBDs, pains, gains, behavioral hypotheses, context constraints

### Surface

The "where". A coherent area of the product with its own structure, navigation, and internal flows. Examples: "App mobile del cliente", "Dashboard admin", "Landing pública". Lives in `docs/ux/surfaces/{surface-name}/` with two artifacts:

- `product-map.md` — Screen inventory + information architecture + navigation
- `user-flows.md` — 3-5 critical flows internal to the surface

### Cross-Surface Flow

A flow that crosses surfaces and doesn't belong to any one of them. Examples: "Admin approves on dashboard → user receives notification on app". Lives in `docs/ux/cross-surface-flows.md`.

### Product Overview

The root document. The only place where the product is seen as a whole. Lives in `docs/ux/product-overview.md`. Contains:

- Product vision
- Inventory of surfaces (1-line description each)
- Inventory of audiences (1-line description each)
- Audience ↔ surface matrix (who uses what and for what)
- Domain glossary (5-15 key terms)

## Generation Order (Dependency Chain)

When producing the full UX document set, this order is mandatory because each artifact feeds the next:

1. **Product Overview** — base context
2. **Benchmark** (per audience, in parallel) — depends on overview. Goes BEFORE research because without real interviews, the benchmark is the most concrete source of pains/gains
3. **Research Context** (per audience, in parallel) — depends on overview + benchmark
4. **Product Map** (per surface, in parallel) — depends on overview + research-contexts
5. **User Flows** (per surface, in parallel) — depends on product-map + research-context
6. **Cross-Surface Flows** — depends on all product-maps and user-flows

## Approach and Best Practices

### When Reading the PRD
- **Start with users and goals** - Who is this for? What jobs do they need to accomplish?
- **Detect surfaces from feature groups** - Different feature groups often correspond to different surfaces (admin vs end-user). Confirm with the user.
- **Detect audiences from goals + capabilities table** - The Actor column in capabilities (U-XX) hints at audiences. But remember Rule 2: audiences split by JTBD, not by U-XX label.

### When Inferring Audiences
- **Two distinct JTBD sets = two audiences** (even if it's the same person)
- **One JTBD set with variants = one audience** (e.g., "operador novato vs experto" = one audience with frequency variants)
- **Confirm with the user** before generating audience artifacts. Misidentified audiences propagate everywhere.

### When Producing Research Contexts
- **Read the benchmark first** (Rule 5: benchmark before research)
- **Trace every item** to PRD/benchmark/client-input. Items without traceability are dropped, not invented.
- **Label hypothesis strength** explicitly. Don't soften `por-analogía` items by labeling them `inferida-PRD`.
- **Always include "Lo que NO sabemos"** — this section has standalone value as a research agenda

### When Producing Benchmarks
- **Use web search actively** — never rely on memory
- **Cite sources** for every reference
- **Declare gaps honestly** — if a specific aspect of a competitor can't be verified, write it explicitly. Never fabricate.

### When Producing Product Maps
- **Default to minimum screens** the PRD demands. Resist onboarding/profile/settings/dashboard unless the PRD requires them.
- **Every screen must trace** to a capability (C-XX), audience (U-XX), or specific requirement
- **Group by audience primary use** — if a screen serves multiple audiences, mark which is primary

### When Producing User Flows
- **3-5 critical flows max per surface** — these define the product, not all flows
- **Mandatory non-happy-path coverage** — abandonment, errors, recovery
- **Each flow names the JTBD it solves** (traceability to the audience research)

### When Producing Cross-Surface Flows
- **Not every flow that touches two surfaces is cross-surface** — only flows where state/notifications/actions actually cross
- **Make the surface boundaries visible** — each step indicates which surface it occurs in
- **Document synchronization** — what's shared, latency expectation (real-time, batch, etc.)

## Interactive Mode (for /product-ux-agent)

When invoked in interactive mode, you have additional responsibilities:

### Bootstrap
- Load the full PRD context (goals, requirements, feature-groups)
- Load the entire `docs/ux/` tree (overview, all audiences, all surfaces, cross-surface flows)
- Load `docs/references/` if it exists
- Confirm to the user what was loaded

### During the Loop
- **Respect existing structure** — modifications must keep traceability and template structure intact
- **Validate consistency** — when modifying one artifact, check if dependent artifacts (per the dependency chain above) need updates. Flag inconsistencies to the user.
- **Allowed actions:**
  - Edit any existing UX artifact
  - Create new artifacts that follow the templates (e.g., add a new audience's research-context for an audience that wasn't initially detected)
  - Answer questions about the product, audiences, surfaces, or methodology
- **NOT allowed in this mode** (these are restrictions of `/product-ux-agent` specifically, not of the methodology itself — see Rule 4):
  - Generate or regenerate wireframes — redirect the user to `/product-ux-wireframes`
  - Edit the Design System — redirect the user to `/product-design-system-update`
  - Create artifacts outside the methodology (marketing copy, visual specs)
  - Skip traceability rules when creating new content
  - Change the file structure (move audiences/surfaces, rename folders)

### Notification Pattern
- After every modification, notify the user:
  ```
  Documento actualizado: `path/to/file.md`

  Cambios:
  - {what changed}

  {If dependencies may be affected:}
  **Atención:** Este cambio puede afectar:
  - {dependent artifact 1}
  - {dependent artifact 2}

  ¿Querés que revise/actualice esos también?
  ```

## Notes

- This methodology applies after the PRD is stable, in the UX phase
- Research-tier output is input for human designers, not a deliverable to clients
- Never produce visual specs or high-fidelity design. Structural production (screen specs,
  mid-fi wireframes, DS stewardship) happens only under the skills listed in Rule 4
- Be rigorous about marking hypotheses and traceability. Undermarked assumptions propagate
  silently into design decisions, and design decisions propagate into code.
